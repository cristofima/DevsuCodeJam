**[1. Toeplitz matrix](https://github.com/cristofima/DevsuCodeJam/blob/master/DevsuCodeJam.Exercises/Difficult/Exercise01.cs)**

In linear algebra, a Toeplitz matrix is an **M x N** matrix in which all of the diagonals from top left to bottom	right have the same value. You must make a function that takes an integer matrix as the input, and returns an integer, indicating how many distinct elements there are. If the matrix is **NOT** a Toeplitz matrix,	return -1. Remember that single elements count as a diagonal. No input will be null.	

**Example:**

**Input:**

1 2 3 4 8 1

5 1 2 3 4 8

4 5 1 2 3 4

7 4 5 1 2 3

**Output:** 7

**[2. Sum to zero](https://github.com/cristofima/DevsuCodeJam/blob/master/DevsuCodeJam.Exercises/Difficult/Exercise02.cs)**

Given an **integer array**, remove all consecutive nodes that sum to zero, and return the remaining nodes. An empty array can very well be an output. If null is received, return an empty array.

**Example:**

**Input:** [3 , 4, -7, 5, -6, 2, 5, -1, 8]

**Output:** [5 , 8]
